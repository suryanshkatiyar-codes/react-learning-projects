Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that lets you style web pages directly in your HTML or JSX using small, single-purpose classes.

Instead of writing custom CSS like:

.card {
  padding: 1rem;
  background: white;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}

You write utilities inline:

<div class="p-4 bg-white rounded-lg">

In brief:

Utility-first: styles are built by combining classes (p-4, flex, text-center)

No custom CSS needed for most layouts

Highly customizable via config

Fast development and consistent design

Popular with React/Next.js projects

One-line summary:
Tailwind lets you design directly in your markup using predefined utility classes instead of writing separate CSS files.
