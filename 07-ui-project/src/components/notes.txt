Atomic-based vs Feature-based are two different ways to organize frontend code, especially in React.

Atomic-based (Atomic Design)

Organizes UI by component size and reusability.

Atoms → buttons, inputs, icons

Molecules → input + label, card header

Organisms → navbar, form section

Templates / Pages → full layouts

Best when:
You want highly reusable UI components and a design-system mindset.

In one line:
Structure by UI complexity and reusability.

Feature-based

Organizes code by application functionality.

auth/ → login, register, auth logic

dashboard/ → charts, tables, services

profile/ → profile page, API, styles

Each feature contains its components, hooks, styles, API.

Best when:
Apps are large, scalable, and worked on by teams.

In one line:
Structure by what the app does, not by component size.

Quick verdict

Atomic-based → design-focused, reusable UI

Feature-based → scalable, maintainable apps

👉 Many real projects combine both: atomic components inside feature folders.
