Think of building a house 🏠.

Atomic-based (small pieces first)

You organize things by how small they are.

One box for buttons

One box for inputs

One box for cards

One box for headers

Each piece is tiny and reusable, like LEGO blocks.
When you build a page, you pick pieces from many boxes and combine them.

In simple words:

“I store parts by what they are.”

Feature-based (grouped by purpose)

You organize things by what they are used for.

One folder for Login

its button

its form

its styles

One folder for Profile

its card

its logic

its styles

Everything related to one feature lives together, like keeping all kitchen items in the kitchen.

In simple words:

“I store parts by what they do.”

Easy comparison

Atomic-based: great when you reuse the same pieces everywhere

Feature-based: great when projects grow and need clarity

One-line takeaway

Atomic = organized by size

Feature = organized by purpose
